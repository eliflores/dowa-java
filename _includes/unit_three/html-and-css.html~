<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ul>
	<li>When you look at a web page in a web browser, you see, at the simplest level, words.</li>
	<li>It is rare to see a web page containing only plain text.</li>
	<li>Instead the words you see and read have style characteristics.</li>  
	<li>Web pages may also contain images, video clips, and background music.</li> 
	<li>They may include drop down menus, search boxes, clickable links to products or other pages.</li>
	<li>within the same website, or links to external web pages.</li>
</ul>

Several technologies (such as <i>CSS</i>, <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>Flash</i>, <i>AJAX</i>, <i>JSON</i>) can be used to define the elements of a web page. However, at the base level, a web page is created using HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Without HTML, there is no web page. <b>HTML is what a browser "reads" to  present the page on the client-side computer.</b>

<h2>HTML</h2>

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is used for creating and visually representing a webpage.

HTML adds "markup" to standard English text. "Hyper Text" refers to links that connect Web pages to one another, making the World Wide Web what it is today. By creating and uploading Web pages to the Internet, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML supports visual images and other media as well. HTML is the language that describes the structure and the semantic content of a web document. These elements form the building blocks of a website.

<h2>CSS</h2>

Cascading Style Sheets, most of the time abbreviated as CSS, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how the structured element must be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

<br/>
CSS is one of the core languages of the open web and has a standardized W3C specification. Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 a recommendation and CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standard track.
