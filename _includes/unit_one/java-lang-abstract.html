<p>An <i>abstract class</i> is a class that is declared abstract. It may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes <b>cannot be instantiated</b>, but they can be subclassed.</p>
<p>An <i>abstract method</i> is a method that is declared without an implementation.</p>
<p>If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract.</p>
