Chewbacca (or "Chewie", as he was known by his friends)
was a legendary Wookiee from Kashyyyk and co-pilot of Han
Solo's ship, the Millennium Falcon. He was the son of Attichitcuk,
the husband of Mallatobuck, and the father of Lumpawaroo. Chewbacca
carried with him the name of an ancient Wookiee hero, the great Bacca,
first of the great chieftains of Kashyyyk, and the creator of a sword that
denoted leadership among the Wookiees. This name placed Chewbacca in a
noble lineage, which was further supported by his role in the Battle
of Kashyyyk during the Clone Wars and during the Galactic Civil War.
